# Car-Price-Prediction

## Aim
### One of the main areas of research in Machine learning is the Prediction of the Price of Cars. It is based on finance and the marketing domain.
### It is a major research topic in machine learning because the price of a car depends on many factors.

### Libraries used :
1.numpy
2.pandas
3.matplotlib
4.seaborn
5.Automate EDA by klib 
6.scikit-learn

### Description
1. This project takes the parameters of an used car like: Company name, Model name, Year of Purchase, Fuel Type and Number of Kilometers it has been driven
   used to predict the price of an car.
2. For example, the image below shows the predicted price of our Maruti Suzuki Swift of 2019 which was driven for 100kms .

### How does this Project does?
 1.First of all the data was taken from Link for data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/balaka18/quikr-cars-scraped
 2. The data was cleaned and analysed.
 3. Then a Linear Regression model was built on top of it which had 0.8897 R2_score.
